- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Spencer

I am a senior Statistics student at IUPUI. My passion is learning new things, especially in the areas of applied math, statistics, and computer science. 
During my Intro to Statistics course, I got my first real taste of data-driven insights when I did an Exploratory Data Analysis project on aggregated user ratings for TV shows.
I obtained new insights that about I site I frequented and it changed the way I interacted with the site. Since then, I have strived to learn new ways to use data to explain 
the phenomenon around me. I have been learning new skills in order to derive insights from different data sets. 
I am particularly interested in data pertaining to social sciences, economics, healthcare, geospatial & operations research.

When I graduate in May 2022, I will be pursuing entry level positions as a Data Analyst.
